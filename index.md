# The Piano Journey

This site presents a guided journey towards learning the basics of playing the piano, a project by [Martina Pugliese](https://martinapugliese.github.io).

## Background

I've been studying the piano for about 8 years when I was younger, and I've learned a lot. I stopped taking lessons mainly due to two factors: I wasn't as good (I was nurturing my skills, but I didn't have natural skills at it) and I had to choose between the piano and going to university - piano lessons aren't that cheap, at least where I'm from and doing both things, especially as I decided to move out to another city for my university choice, simply wasn't possible. However, it's been a great journey for me and it certainly shaped my brain and my hands, and being able today to still sit at a piano and move the hands is an invaluable ability I really cherish - it provides something nice to do,
When I say I studied the piano I mean I studied the piano for classical music. And when I say I wasn't that good at it I mean that it took me study, dedication and mistakes to be able to play something: the result was good but it was clear enough I didn't have a musician career in front of me. I've been studying privately (with private teachers that I was seeing weekly), not at an institution (a Conservatory), which would have been more of an education choice alternative to going to other schools/university - I've always been studying music on top of regular education rather than a career choice per se.

I've also been taking some exams at the Conservatory. I'm Italian by the way, and a lot of the references here (especially books) will be Italian ones for this reason, I've studied music in my country. Nevertheless, I think that whatever your nationality and mothertongue, you can use them.

The site loosely follows the journey I've been going through to learn how to play, which I'm keen to share with others. This is not meant to be a "professional" guide, nor to replace "formal" music education - if you really want to study the piano to become a musician, you may want to consider enrolling in a school/conservatory or taking private lessons. This project is just aimed at narrating the path I've been following throughout the years and help people who want to approach music do so - use it as you please! I think there's lots of people, of any age, interested in doing some music, that may not know where to start; here I hope to share some knowledge, maybe make them try something and just have fun while learning a new skill. Or, this can be used to integrate your studies, whatever suits.

## Structure and how to use

This site is a natural work in progress - I'll be continuously adding elements to the journey as I'm writing this one bit at a time rather than as a one-off dump of material. If you come back here occasionally you may find additions. The contents of a page won't change, I will always publish a piece of material a page when I've written about it in full, but I will append new sections, and nnew pages to existing sections one at a time.
The journey is presented as a list of material to study (mostly from exercise books), there will also be YouTube links and other kinds of material you can peruse to learn. I will also try to put historical notes and information about what you learn, pointing you to other resources: this project is not intended as a (boring) list of exercises to do but rather as a voyage where you get to see different things, including some little theory and history of music. It's very much intended as a guided collection of information and material.

The contents here are designed to be explored (and exploited) in the order below - obviously though, you're free to use this as you please! In fact, as I'm doing this to share with others, I'd love to have feedback and hear about how you use this, please feel free to reach out ([twitter](https://twitter.com/m_letitbe) is a good way). Please let me know of anything, including mistakes/imprecisions/anything I could improve - I'm also doing this for myself to learn more (teaching is learning twice, right?).

Remember, the piano is a marvelous instrument (I love all music, but the piano will remain my favourite). And it's for everyone to enjoy. Playing it seriously takes lots of time and effort (like most things, doing something well requires dedication), but I believe everyone can enjoy the beauty of doing and learning some music, even on their little own.

What do you need to know to start with this? Not much, or nothing really - the journey will start with the very first baby steps (such as placing the hands on a keyboard and read music), in the [Fundamentals section](#Fundamentals), which you can skip if you don't need.
