# Positioning the hands on a keyboard

Learning to place your hands on a keyboard is essential to start, and then learning to move them is necessary to be able to play something, and eventually acquire agility.

First of all, you need to sit with the right posture: straight back, and use a correct height of your seat with respect to the keyboard - you don't want to bend over it and you don't want to have to reach high - the elbows have to be at a natural height; this is why pianos are equipped with seats which are adjustable in height. Of course, YouTube has plenty of videos that would show you some examples if you're unsure.

Afterwards, how to place the hands? Learning the right hand position is essential and is really where you should focus to start with if you've never done it as this needs to become a natural skill that you will keep forever - I think my very first weeks of learning to play were spent non doing much more than plying a few keys with the right hand position so that it'd become ingrained.

The gist of it is that you need to have your hand curved ("curved" fingers) and your wrist at a natural height: not high, not low. This will provide the fingers and the whole hand with the mechanical possibility to be agile. It may not seem like making a difference when you're starting to push a few keys, but it will in the long run: it's a bit like learning the most appropriate position for freestyle swimming.

This one here is a nice video - she shows the right placement of the hand:

The exercise here is all about practicing this. Chances are, your hand will tend to flatten when you first attempt moving it across the keys, and you need to put a bit of effort in preventing that. Try getting yourself comfortable with keeping a curved hand and a mobile/soft wrist.
