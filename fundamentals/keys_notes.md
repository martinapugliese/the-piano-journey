# Keys and notes

You obviously need to know how to read music, especially that for piano. The piano uses two of the three existing clefs, so you'd normally see piano music written as such:

We have two staves (or "staffs" if you're American): a stave consists of 5 lines and 4 spaces, numbered from the bottom, so you go from the first line to the fifth line and from the first space to the fourth space. These staves joined by a curly bracket, each with its own clef: a treble clef above and a bass clef below.

The treble clef, also called a G-clef, indicates the location of the G note on the second line, the bass clef indicates the location of the F note on the line wrapped by the two dots, in this case the fourth. The symbol used here for the bass clef is used in music for other clefs, according to the position of the F note, this is why these clefs are generally called the F-clefs. In music, there are also C-clefs, which indicate the position of the C note; the piano however uses a treble clef and a bass clef.

Now onto notes. You'd probably heard the common sequence of notes in a C scale (C-D-E-F-G-A-B): this is exactly what the image above illustrates: both clefs are showing the same scale, starting from the same note (the very first one is a C, also called the "middle C"). The middle C would normally be right in the middle of your keyboard, whatever its size, which is also where (usually) you have the start of the brand name.

Keys indicating different notes have different shapes on a piano, look at this illustration (Tobias R., via Wiikimedia Commons):

The middle C should now be quite easy to spot, look at this nice video that stresses the point:

The exercise here is to familiarise with the keys of a piano, getting comfortable with finding the middle C without having to think, and looking at staves in piano notation to get used to it.
